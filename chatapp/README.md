Simple chat window app using React Native (create-react-native-app) and Firebase

It handles only a chat between 2 annonymous users in a hardcoded session. The propose is just to see how would it work with both technologies.

However, it can be upgraded to get the chatId dynamically from a list of users, handles user profile, share images and voice records, and so on.
